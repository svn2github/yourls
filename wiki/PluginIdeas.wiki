#summary A few ideas or whishlist for plugins

YOURLS 1.5 features a super cool plugin API (see [Plugins]). Here are a few plugins ideas I might make

  * ~~Random keyword URL~~ (see Issue 123) See PluginRandomKeywords
  * More control over keyword URLs: custom character set for instance
  * Spam control & URL blacklists
  * Anti bruteforce login with blacklisting IP after a number of failed attempts
  * ~~Toolbar~~ (see Issue 228) Implemented a core plugin
  * ~~Share to any other site/service in bookmarklet~~ See PluginShareTumblr 
  * QR Codes (see Issue 300 for an unofficial plugin)
