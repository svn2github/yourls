#summary A few ideas or whishlist for plugins

YOURLS 1.5 will feature a super cool plugin API (see [Plugins]). Here are a few plugins ideas I might make

  * Random keyword URL (see Issue 123)
  * More control over keyword URLs: custom character set for instance
  * Spam control & URL blacklists
  * Anti bruteforce login with blacklisting IP after a number of failed attempts
  * Toolbar (see Issue 228)
  * Share to any other site/service in bookmarklet
  * QR Codes
