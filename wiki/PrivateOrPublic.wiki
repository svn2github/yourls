#summary Public or Private? Setting 'YOURLS_PRIVATE' explained

In your `config.php` you have to define constant `YOURLS_PRIVATE`. It can be one of these two lines:
{{{
// Private :
define( 'YOURLS_PRIVATE', true );
// Or public :
define( 'YOURLS_PRIVATE', false );
}}}

= Private =

Setting to `define( 'YOURLS_PRIVATE', true );` (default setting) will make your admin area (`http://sho.rt/admin/`) protected by a login/password form.

= Public =

Setting to `define( 'YOURLS_PRIVATE', false );` will make your admin area *free to access* to anyone with the URL. Use this only if you're running a test setup, or for a setup shared by colleagues on a private intranet, for instance.

Also, since there is no login/password needed, there will be no Secret Token on the Tools page for the PasswordlessAPI.

= Private + Public Interface =

If you want to run your own little bitly, you want to :
  * set your install to *private* : `define( 'YOURLS_PRIVATE', true );`
  * install a *public interface* in the root directory. There's a sample one provided in the package (see `sample-public-front-page.php.txt`)
