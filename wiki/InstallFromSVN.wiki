= Running SVN =

The "SVN" (or "trunk") version is usually stable enough for live servers. My main shortener at http://ozh.in/ is running on trunk.

Occasionaly I may label a version a "X.XX-alpha-dont-use" so you may want to check the current [http://code.google.com/p/yourls/source/browse/trunk/includes/version.php version.php] first.

Running trunk is a great way to have the latest features before everyone else. It's also a great way to experience a few bugs before them, but hopefully report them so you can contribute to better software :)


= How-to for newbies =

Crash tutorial for Windows users:

  * Install [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads TortoiseSVN]
  * Create a new directory
  * Right click on that directory, chose "SVN Checkout"
  * Checkout from the URL http://yourls.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  * That's it.

Now it'll take a click to update your YOURLS install.

= Nightly Builds =

Every night the current trunk is compiled into a regular zip archive. You can find these unofficial packages here: http://yourls.org/nightly-builds/
