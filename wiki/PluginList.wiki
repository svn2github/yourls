This page will list known YOURLS plugins (till there are too many and this become impractical)

*This page is not meant to file plugin requests or suggestions*. For plugin requests read wiki page [http://code.google.com/p/yourls/wiki/PossibleWithAPlugin PossibleWithAPlugin]

= Core plugins =

Core plugins are bundled with YOURLS. They aim to either provide sample code for people who want to make their own plugins (it's easy!), or implement often requested features.

= Normal plugins =

These plugins are written (and hopefully maintained) by various YOURLS users (a few by Ozh http://yourls.googlecode.com/files/ozh.png)

Note that being listed here does not guarantee that the plugin is approved, its code is clean, future proof or anything (unless it's been made by Ozh of course ;)

= Get your plugin listed here =

You made a plugin? Awesome news! Getting your plugin listed here is easy:
  # First, get your plugin hosted somewhere. Prefer more established platforms such as Google Code or Github rather than a pastebin clone.
  # Your plugin should be announced where users can post comments, submit bug reports and give feedback. If you have your own blog, that's perfect. A Github page is very fine too.
  # Last part: once step 1 and 2 are completed, ask Ozh to get listed here. The safest way is to send an email to `ozh at ozh dot org`
