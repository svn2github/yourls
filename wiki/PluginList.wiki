#summary List of known YOURLS plugins
#labels Featured,Plugin

This page will list known YOURLS plugins (till there are too many and this become impractical)

*This page is not meant to file plugin requests or suggestions*. For plugin requests see wiki page [http://code.google.com/p/yourls/wiki/PossibleWithAPlugin PossibleWithAPlugin]

= Core plugins =

Core plugins are bundled with YOURLS. They aim to either provide sample code for people who want to make their own plugins (it's easy!), or implement often requested features.

= Normal plugins =

These plugins are written (and hopefully maintained) by Ozh http://yourls.googlecode.com/files/ozh.png or other YOURLS users. Because a plugin is listed here does not guarantee that its code is clean, future proof or anything (unless it's been made by Ozh and as long as he works for the project;)

= Get your plugin listed here =

You made a plugin? Awesome news! Getting your plugin listed here is easy:
  # First, get your plugin hosted somewhere. Prefer more established platforms such as Google Code or Github rather than a pastebin clone.
  # Your plugin should be announced where users can post comments, submit bug reports and give feedback. If you have your own blog, that's perfect. A Github page is very fine too.
  # Last part: once step 1 and 2 are completed, ask Ozh to get listed here. The safest way is to send an email to `ozh at ozh dot org`
