#summary YOURLS Coding Standards or your patch won't make it
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

Patches are _very very_ welcome, but they have to be _very very_ compliant to *YOURLS Coding Standards* or they'll otherwise be rejected.

= #1 Rules Or Die =

  * *Readability* is more important than cleverness or brevity.
  * Submit a patch against the SVN version or a nightly build .zip, *not* the latest official package available. See [http://code.google.com/p/yourls/wiki/InstallFromSVN InstallFromSVN]

= Naming conventions =

Use lowercase letters and underscores in variable and function names (never camelCase like `doTableResult`). Use unambiguous and self-documenting names instead of generic and meaningless names (eg `function2()` or `global $a`)

In core patches, always prefix all your PHP functions with `yourls_`.

In plugins, prefix everything (functions, classes, global variables, HTML elements...) with a unique and personal prefix such as `joe_myplugin_`


= Comments =

There are *never* too many comments and I'd rather strip a few out before committing a patch than pull my hair trying to understand what's going on.

For simple explanations, use inline commenting. For larger explanation, don't hesitation to break in multiple lines using `/* ... */`


= Indentation and White Space =

Your code must reflect logical structure and be easy on the eye
  * Use tabs at the beginning of a line, spaces mid-line
  * Align as many things as possible where it improves readability
  * Vertically align begining of line blocks and end of blocks with opening and closing parenthesis `()`, brackets `[] ` and braces `{}`

Put white space anywhere it will make your code _breathe_

{{{
// if, elseif, foreach, for and switch blocks
foreach( $array as $key => $value } { ...

// define a function
function do_stuff( $param1= 'foo', $param2 = 'bar' ) { ...

// call a function
do_stuff( '31337', other_func( 42 ) );

// white space around variable array items 
$x = $foo['bar']; // string, no space = OK
$y = $foo[ $bar ]; // variable, need spaces

}}}


= PHP tags =

*Never* use shorthand PHP tags, because some servers are not configured to interpret them. *Always* use full PHP tag.

Correct:
{{{
<?php ... ?>
}}}

Forbidden:
{{{
<? ... ?>
<?= $var ?>
}}}

It is also best to omit the final closing PHP tag of a PHP file

= Turn debugging on =

Always develop with error reporting on. In YOURLS, this means you should add this to your dev `config.php` :
{{{
define( 'YOURLS_DEBUG', true );
}}}
