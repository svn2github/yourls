= Make a .htaccess file =

If .htaccess file creation/updating failed because of file permission, you'll have to manually make one. It's simple.


= Case: YOURLS installed on root =

If YOURLS root URL is http://yoursite/, the .htaccess file in the root directory must be like:

{{{
# BEGIN YOURLS
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)/?$ /yourls-go.php?id=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)\+/?$ /yourls-infos.php?id=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)\+all/?$ /yourls-infos.php?id=$1&all=1 [L]

</IfModule>
# END YOURLS
}}}

= Case: YOURLS installed in subdirectory =

If YOURLS root URL is http://yoursite/somedir/, the .htaccess file in this subdirectory must be like:

{{{
# BEGIN YOURLS
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /somedir/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)/?$ /somedir/yourls-go.php?id=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)\+/?$ /somedir/yourls-infos.php?id=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^([0-9A-Za-z]+)\+all/?$ /somedir/yourls-infos.php?id=$1&all=1 [L]
</IfModule>
# END YOURLS
}}}

= Bonus: Force non-WWW =

Add this at the beginning of the .htaccess file

{{{
# BEGIN WithoutWWW
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.yourls\.org$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://yourls.org/$1 [R=301,L]
# END WithoutWWW
}}}
