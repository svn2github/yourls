= Make a .htaccess file =

If .htaccess file creation/updating failed because of file permission, you'll have to manually make one. It's simple.

*Note:* as stated in various places such as the readme, YOURLS *cannot share* its root directory with another .htaccess rewrite rules driven app such as WordPress. The .htaccess file should contain YOURLS directives and no other rewrite rule.


= Case: YOURLS installed on root =

If YOURLS root URL is http://yoursite/, the .htaccess file in the root directory must be like:

{{{
# BEGIN YOURLS
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /yourls-loader.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END YOURLS
}}}

= Case: YOURLS installed in subdirectory =

If YOURLS root URL is http://yoursite/somedir/, the .htaccess file in this subdirectory must be like:

{{{
# BEGIN YOURLS
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /somedir/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /somedir/yourls-loader.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END YOURLS
}}}

= Bonus: Force non-WWW =

Add this after the YOURLS block in your .htaccess file, replacing `yourls.org` with your own domain

{{{
# BEGIN WithoutWWW
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.yourls\.org$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://yourls.org/$1 [R=301,L]
# END WithoutWWW
}}}

This directive *MAY or MAY NOT work on your host* (ie `http://sho.rt/stuff` might work fine and `http://www.sho.rt/stuff` might not). If it doesn't work, simply stick to one domain, either with or without www. There is no real support for both www and non-www domain setup.

(This is unlikely to get improved, to be honest. I don't get why people insist on adding 4 extra characters ("www.") to their URL _shortener_...)
