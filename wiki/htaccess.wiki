= Make a .htaccess file =

If .htaccess file creation/updating failed because of file permission, you'll have to manually make one. It's simple.


= Case: YOURLS installed on root =

If YOURLS root URL is http://yoursite/, the .htaccess file in the root directory must be like:

{{{
# BEGIN YOURLS
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /yourls-loader.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END YOURLS
}}}

= Case: YOURLS installed in subdirectory =

If YOURLS root URL is http://yoursite/somedir/, the .htaccess file in this subdirectory must be like:

{{{
# BEGIN YOURLS
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /somedir/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /somedir/yourls-loader.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END YOURLS
}}}

= Bonus: Force non-WWW =

Add this *at the beginning* of the .htaccess file, replacing `yourls.org` with your own domain

{{{
# BEGIN WithoutWWW
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.yourls\.org$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://yourls.org/$1 [R=301,L]
# END WithoutWWW
}}}
