#summary How to make Plugins for YOURLS

*!!!! This page is not complete yet. Still under work !!!!*

= Plugins =

Plugins are additional PHP scripts that extend the functionalities or features of YOURLS. The core of YOURLS is designed to be as light as possible and avoid bloat (implementing functions not everybody needs) and to allow for easy customization.

Using the plugin architecture, you can implement new features without having to modify core files. This way, your changes won't be lost when you upgrade your YOURLS installation.

= Structure of a Plugin File =

A plugin file needs to be named `plugin.php` and to be located in its own subdirectory of `[YOURLS_ROOT]/user/plugins`, eg:
{{{
YOURLS_ROOT/user/plugins/my_sample_plugin/plugin.php
}}}

The plugin file `plugin.php` needs to begin with a header like the following one:
{{{
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: My Sample Plugin
Plugin URI: http://mysite.com/yourls-sample-plugin/
Description: This plugin does something and something else
Version: 1.0
Author: Ozh
Author URI: http://ozh.org/
*/
}}}

= Plugin API =

YOURLS core uses two 'hooks', *filters* and *actions*, allowing your plugin to 'hook into' what YOURLS does.

  * *actions* are the hooks YOURLS triggers at specific points or during specific action. It's a way of telling "hey, this particular event just occured", so your plugin can execute a defined function at this point.
  * *filters* are the hooks YOURLS triggers to allow modification of a variable before returning it, sending it into the database or displaying it.
