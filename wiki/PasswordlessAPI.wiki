#summary Secure and passwordless API requests
#labels Featured

YOURLS allows API calls the old fashioned way, using `username` and `password` parameters (if your setup is private, obviously). If you're worried about sending your credentials into the wild, you can also make API calls using a secret signature token.

= Signature token =

Your secret signature token will be a string like `3002a61584`

A secret signature token is unique, associated to one account, and can be used only for API requests. You will find it in the Tools page of your YOURLS install.

*NB*: Can't see this signature on the Tools page? It's probably because your install is public. Therefore, you don't use a login and password to use it. Therefore there's no signature token to be used instead of a login/password pair.

= Usage of the signature token =

Use parameter `signature` in your API requests. Example:

`http://yoursite/yourls-api.php?signature=3002a61584&action=...`

= Usage of a time limited signature token =

You can create signature token valid for a short period only (one hour by default)

First, craft the time limited signature token:

{{{
<?php
$timestamp = time();
$signature = md5( $timestamp . '3002a61584' );
// Replace with your own secret signature token. Example result:
// $signature = "ed8d12124fc7916b00e3ecd7dc2c1d6a"
?>
}}}

Now use parameters `signature` and `timestamp` in your API requests. Example:

`http://yoursite/yourls-api.php?timestamp=$timestamp&signature=$signature&action=...`

This URL would be valid for only 3600 seconds
