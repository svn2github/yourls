= Stuff that should be worked on =

There are things that would greatly or nicely improve YOURLS. If you feel like working on one of them, please get in touch :)

  * A more sophisticated stat Dashboard
  * Nicer admin interface
  * User management (multi user, user roles, no more plain text passwords in config file)
  * Multisite feature (one install to manage several domains)
  * Complete installer & options managed through an admin page (no more config.php editing)
  * Interface localization (Issue 52)
  * Theme support ?
  * Related: an enqueue/dequeue API for JS & CSS files like in WP
  * A pseudo cron like in WP -- needs improvement of the HTTP functions to handle timeouts
  * Archiving hit logs by day/month/year to save DB space (needs cron support I guess)
  * OAuth, possibly in a core plugin. See http://dev.bitly.com/authentication.html
